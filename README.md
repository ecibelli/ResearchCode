# Research Code

Samples of research scripts developed during my academic career.

<b>powerSimulation_tongueTwisterReplication.R:</b> 
Power simulation for replication of a study on the production of tongue twisters. This script walks through the procedure to replicate an experimental study (McMillan & Corley 2010) measuring voice onset time (a durational property of consonants like "b" and "k"). The goal of the script is to determine how many participants would be needed to replicate a key effect from the study. More detail about the project can be found here: https://osf.io/zcr9p/

<b>analyzeBurstSpectra_dissertation:</b>
Several versions of a script designed to analyze a particular acoustic cue in the production of certain consonants. The place of articulation (position in the mouth where a speech sound is made) of a stop consonant like "t" or "k" can be cued in part by the spectral properties of the stop burst. This code takes several measurements of the burst spectrum and uses it to assess whether or not learners of Hindi are distinguishing between two place categories - dental and retroflex. The .R version shows the original script; the .md version presents a markdown report (created by the .rmd file) that embeds figures and code output directly in the report. The data and analysis is taken from my dissertation, which can be accessed here: https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt9tq441d9/qt9tq441d9.pdf
