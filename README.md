powerSimulation_tongueTwisterReplication.R: Power simulation for replication of tongue twister study.
This script walks through the procedure to replicate an experimental study measuring voice onset time (a durational property of consonants like "b" and "k"). The goal of the script is to determine how many participants would be needed to replicate a key effect from the study. More detail about the project can be found here: https://osf.io/zcr9p/
